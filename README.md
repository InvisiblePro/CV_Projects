# CV_Projects
This Repo is based on Computer Vision Projects. Using Cameras and Vision devices with programming to make it useful for the people of the world.


This project aims for the program to use and utilise the ability of Computer vision with AI and ML algorithms to innovate new technology. 

## Steps for Contribution:-

1. User should create a separate folder named after their project and it should contain the main program file named `main.py` and other data files accordingly.

2. Program should be executable with any system, if specific versions are required then mention them in the file.

3. For installation of modules, create a `requirement.txt` file with modules and its versions

4. If program executes properly on our tests, then PR will be accepted.

**These steps must be followed to have an Acceptable PR.

## Features to the Users:-
This project could contribute to and plan the future roadmap for advancement in the field of Computer Vision technology.

- CV technology can mainly contribute to the aspect of Security. 

- It can also used for Machine learning based on CV interacting with real-life factors and to analyse for data recognition.

All contributors are gratefully welcomed ✨
